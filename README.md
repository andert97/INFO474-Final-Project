# INFO474-Final-Project

Our group chose the yelp dataset because it is a large enough data set to explore many visualizations and gain insights into businesses and users. This information can be used to make important decisions for yelp and for the businesses featured on yelp. There are many questions that we can address but we want our visualizations to focus on answering 

How do favorite foods differ throughout cities in the US? 

This question will help Yelp cater to the needs of users by featuring these foods at the forefront of advertisements, listing pages, etc. Additionally, it can help businesses determine what food is the most popular so that they can attempt to make their business geared towards more customers.

Viz #2: Popular Cuisine Bar Graph (https://andert97.github.io/INFO474-Final-Project/viz2/)
This bar graph shows the count of restaurants for a select group of cuisines. A user can filter this by city to see how the popular cuisines change. If the user hovers over the bar they can see the exact count of restaurants. This answers our question because it shows how taste in cuisine changes for different cities.
